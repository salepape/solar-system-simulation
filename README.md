# Solar System Simulation

## Presentation

This project is the main one after obtaining my double diploma in Computer Science. It is developed under Visual Studio 17 with Windows 10. The user can move within the Solar System composed of celestial bodies (planets, main dwarf planets and moons) moving along their orbits, as well as the main belts (asteroid and Kuiper ones). It is also possible to make some information appear on the top of celestial bodies. Some comments within the code describes more precisely how it works (algorithmic, decisions taken and so on). The project is still under development in order to learn new OpenGL concepts and make the simulation even more realistic.

## Controls

To be able to discover the Solar System, the user should use the following basic controls :
* <kbd>Z</kbd>, <kbd>Q</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>left mouse button</kbd>, <kbd>right mouse button</kbd> to move the camera respectively forward, backward, left, right, up or down;
* <kbd>X</kbd> to increase camera speed when moving;
* <kbd>mouse scroll wheel</kbd> to zoom in / out on the scene;
* <kbd>up arrow</kbd> and <kbd>down arrow</kbd> to accelerate or decelerate the simulation;
* <kbd>space</kbd> to pause the simulation and make information appear;
* <kbd>Esc</kbd> to quit the simulation.

## Resources

* Data have been retrieved from NASA website mainly (National Space Science Data Center);
* Textures have been downloaded from https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/, http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html and websites of passionate people;
* Some parts of OpenGL code have been inspired from https://learnopengl.com/, http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ and https://open.gl/ mainly.
